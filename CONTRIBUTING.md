# Internal development guide

goose-note is licensed under the MIT License; see [LICENSE](./LICENSE).
Contributions must be compatible with that license and preserve third-party
notices (see [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt](./THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt)).

## Development setup

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the primary package manager and runtime.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the dev server (http://localhost:6001)
bun run dev

# Build the uTools plugin bundle
bun run build
```

Node.js `>=20` is required if you run the toolchain without Bun.

## Before opening an internal pull request

Run the same checks CI runs, locally:

```bash
bun run typecheck   # tsc -b --noEmit
bun run lint        # eslint .
bun run build       # full production build
```

All checks must pass. CI runs them on every internal pull request to `main` and
`dev`.

## Branching & commits

- Branch off **`main`**. The repository currently uses `main` as its pull-request base.
- Keep pull requests focused — one logical change per PR.
- Write commit messages in the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  style, e.g. `feat: add word-count footer`, `fix: prevent cursor jump on toggle`.
- Commit messages and PR descriptions may use English or Simplified Chinese; keep each
  pull request internally consistent.

## Code style

- TypeScript + React. ESLint config lives in `eslint.config.js`.
- Match the conventions of the surrounding code (naming, formatting, comment density).
- Avoid `any` where a real type is reasonable — `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`
  is enabled as a warning.

## Reporting bugs & requesting features

Authorized collaborators should use the private project tracker and include
reproduction steps, the environment (OS, uTools version or browser), and
expected versus actual behavior.

## Maintainer review checklist

Use this when reviewing internal pull requests.

1. **Correct diff** — Review the PR’s real remote head (not a stale local branch with the same name).
2. **Merge gate** — `typecheck`, `lint`, and full `build` (includes the quick-note plugin build).
3. **Scope** — One logical change; Conventional Commits; no `tasks/`, `.env*`, or AI-only tooling artifacts.
4. **Editor** — Changes under `src/components/editor/` must not break **title block one** (first block is always H1; see `AGENTS.md` / `firstTitleGuard.ts`).
5. **uTools UI** — Style changes must avoid Tailwind alpha/palette traps that fail in the uTools WebView; prefer CSS variables in `src/index.css`. Browser dev alone is not enough for hover/selected states.
6. **Dual plugin** — Shared code must still build for both the main app and `GOOSE_BUILD_TARGET=quicknote` / `__GOOSE_LITE__`.
7. **Data** — Persistence and local-folder sync changes must not lose or silently overwrite notes.
8. **Security** — No hardcoded secrets or personal paths in defaults; see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
9. **Verification** — Ask for a short **Testing** note in the PR when behavior changes. CI runs typecheck, lint, and the full build.

Local uTools smoke test after `bun run build`: load `dist/plugin.json` in the uTools developer tools (see README).
